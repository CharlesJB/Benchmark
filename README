This repository contain the tools that will be coded for the peak calling benchmark project

// Programs:

eland2bed.cpp
	Convert the output of the eland aligner to bed format


// Scripts:
Note: All the scripts use DarkFishTechnology to manage cache, log commands and run
commands in parallel. (see https://github.com/sebhtml/NGS-Pipelines)

BenchmarkTools
	Collection of tools that are used in *_Analysis scripts


*_Analysis.sh

Usage 1:
*_Analysis.sh NumberOfProcessors Output FileFormat Options TreatmentFile ControlFile

Usage 2:
*_Analysis.sh NumberOfProcessors Output FileFormat Options BatchFile

	NumberOfProcessors: 	The number of processor the script is allowed to use.

	Output:			Name of the folder that will contain the analysis 
				and prefix that will be used for the result files.

	FileFormat: 		bed or eland for usage 1.
				txt for usage 2.

	Options: 		The list of options in the same format as specified 
				in each program documentation, between quotation 
				marks. 

	TreatmentFile: 		The treatment file to analyze. Use relative path 
				starting from current working directory.

	ControlFile:		The background file to analyse. Use relative 
				path starting from current working directory. 
				Optional.

	BatchFile		File containing a list of dataset to be analyzed.
				Contains three columns separated by tabs:
					1- FileFormat (bed or eland)
					2- TreatmentFile
					3- ControlFile

Important:

 SISSR_Analysis.sh

	The Options field should at least include the genome size.
	Example: "-s 3200000000"

 MACS_Analysis.sh

	The Options field should at least include the reference genome.
